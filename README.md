mathematical tools

Among other things this project contains solutions for typical programming beginner tasks. 
All scripts work in a terminal.

### How users can get started:
You need python on your machine. 
I use python 3.7 and higher. 
If you use another version you may encounter problems.
__Please be aware that some scripts need another script (like input control) in the same directory.__
It is recommended to check if that is the case before you move a single script in another directory. 
(You can check that by looking what the project imports at the beginning of a script.)

### How to start a script:
Type in a terminal (Linux):
  "python" or "python3" [script-name] 
  
### Where users can get help:
Please write a comment.
